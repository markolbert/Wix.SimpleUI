# Wix.SimpleUI

This is a user interface library for interacting with the Wix Toolset Bootstrapper. 
The Bootstrapper handles the details of managing a Windows installation/de-installation
action, while the framework makes it easier (hopefully :)) to create a wizard to
guide the Bootstrapper process.

You can learn more about the Wix Toolset at http://wixtoolset.org/. But I also
highly recommend you buy Wix 3.6: A Developer's Guide, by Nick Ramirez. Because
the Wix Toolset has a steep learning curve.

An example installer using the framework is available at https://github.com/markolbert/Installers,
in the LanHistoryInstaller project. It manages installation of Lan History Manager,
which is available at https://github.com/markolbert/LanHistory.
